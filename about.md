Hi! My name's JR Heard. I'm a staff engineer at [Seesaw](https://seesaw.com/). I think pure functions are the greatest. I live in Portland with my cat <a href='{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/frank.jpg'>Frank</a> and partner [Keely](https://keelyclaire.net/).

I like breaking big problems into little pieces, and I like shipping each little piece to customers as soon as it's finished. I like to explain programming-related concepts to people who are interested in learning about them. I like asking questions. Here's my [resume](/resume.pdf).

I'm always interested in learning about how a programmer can make a dent in the fields of transportation, energy, and/or education. You can reach me at jrrrheard@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by!
