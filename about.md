My name's JR Heard. Here's my [resume][resume].

[resume]: http://jrheard.com/resume.pdf

I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Stanford University (2010).

I worked as a web developer for [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com) for six years.

* My job titles were intern, contractor, full-time software engineer, and then tech lead.
* I wrote a lot of server-side Python code, primarily related to implementing (or fixing) specific features of the website.
* I wrote most of the original code that makes Yelp's locale-style subdomain+tld combinations — e.g. [fr.yelp.ca](http://fr.yelp.ca), [de.biz.yelp.ch](https://de.biz.yelp.ch/), etc — work. This didn't get a lot of press, but it was a very scary change to make, and nothing bad happened when I made it.
* I wrote a system called [RequestBucketer](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2014/02/introducing-requestbucketer-a-system-for-putting-http-requests-in-named-buckets.html), which is useful for conducting A/B tests and feature rollouts.
* I did lots of other stuff, check out my [resume][resume].

I'm currently happily unemployed. I'm not actively looking for work, but am interested in working on these problems: self-driving cars (car ownership should not be the default, and humans shouldn't be allowed to drive); climate change (oh god); obesity (it'd be great to live in a world where it isn't extremely difficult to not be obese).

If you know anyone who's working on one of those problems and is looking for part-time remote employees, send them my way!
