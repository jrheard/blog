Hi! My name's JR Heard. I'm a senior engineer at [Ride Report](https://www.ridereport.com/). I think pure functions are the greatest. I live in Portland with my cat <a href='{% asset_path frank.jpg %}'>Frank</a>.

I like writing computer programs. Mainly the server-side part of websites. Here's my [resume][resume].

I'm interested in learning about how a programmer can make a dent in the fields of transportation, energy, and/or education. You can reach me at jrrrheard@gmail.com.

Thanks for stopping by!
